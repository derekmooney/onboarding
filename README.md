# onboarding
I received a version of this list from a friend who joined the Product organization at a previous job. My reaction was "who the hell is this guy asking so many questions?", so if that's **your** reaction, I get it! 

I have a few goals with these questions:
1. Build initial knowledge about the business and organization.
2. Learn how Engineering works and interacts with the other parts of the organization.
3. Inform where I should ask more questions.
